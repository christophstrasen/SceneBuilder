description=⚙️ SceneBuilder — Scene Authoring Library for Project Zomboid (Build 42)

SceneBuilder is a developer library intended for experienced modders and for Build 42 only.
It provides tools for declarative scene construction, prefab authoring, and surface-aware object placement inside the world.

⚠️ This is not gameplay content. It does nothing on its own.
You are expected to understand Project Zomboid's Lua modding to a basic level before using it.
