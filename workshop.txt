description=SceneBuilder - A Scene Authoring Library for Project Zomboid (Build 42)

SceneBuilder is a developer library intended for experienced modders.
It provides tools for declarative scene construction, prefab authoring,
and surface-aware object placement inside the world.

This is not gameplay content. It does nothing on its own.
You are expected to understand Project Zomboid's Lua modding and programming concepts.
