description=
description=SceneBuilder is a scene composition framework for mid-level Lua mod developers.
description=It lets you spawn coherent in-world scenes in a declarative way (corpses, containers,
description=clutter, blood, and more), using anchors, resolvers, and composable placers.
description=
description=Highlights:
description=- surface-aware item placement
description=- deterministic scenes by default (same inputs yield the same layout)
description=- extensible via custom resolvers and spawn hooks
description=
description=This is a developer library, not gameplay content. It does nothing on its own.
