description=SceneBuilder - Scene authoring library for Project Zomboid (Build 42)

NOT TESTED IN MULTIPLAYER. DON'T USE THERE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. thx.

SceneBuilder is a scene composition framework for mid-level Lua mod developers.
It lets you spawn coherent in-world scenes in a declarative way (corpses, containers,
clutter, blood, and more), using anchors, resolvers, and composable placers.

Highlights:
- surface-aware item placement
- deterministic scenes by default (same inputs yield the same layout)
- extensible via custom resolvers and spawn hooks

This is a developer library, not gameplay content. It does nothing on its own.
