# Usage Advice — Working With ChatGPT on This Repo

## Files to keep updated and load into default context:

.chatgpt/context.md

--- 

## Preparing once or when refreshing

- Upload a tar.gz of the Contents/mods/SceneBuilder/42/media/lua/shared/SceneBuilder folder once to your AI project and ask it to unpack, fully parse it. Test it by asking how many lines of lua code each of our files contain.
- Maybe Change editor and style preferences.

## Potential Additional Files (add later as needed if the project grows)
- `todos.md` — living task list (`- [ ]` checkboxes, priorities).
- `decisions.md` — short ADR entries (decision, alternatives, rationale).
