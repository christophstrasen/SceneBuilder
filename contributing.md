# Contributing to SceneBuilder

SceneBuilder is a declarative scene building library for Project Zomboid Build 42.

It is part of the wider DREAM mod family:
- Maintainer convenience repo (multi-repo sync/watch): https://github.com/christophstrasen/DREAM-Workspace

## Development quickstart

See: `development.md`.

## Expectations

- Keep changes small and reviewable.
- Prefer deterministic behavior and clear failure modes (scene placement should be debuggable).
- Avoid breaking the published `mod.info` surface unless there’s a strong reason (the mod is already on Workshop).
